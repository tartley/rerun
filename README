Rerun
=====

Re-run the given command every time files under the current directory are
updated.

Usage
=====

::

    rerun [--help|-h] [--verbose|-v] [--ignore|-i=<file>] [--version] <command>

Positional arguments::

    <command>               Command to execute

Optional arguments::

    --help|-h           Show this help message and exit.
    --verbose|-v        Display the names of changed files before the command
                        output.
    --ignore|-i=<file>  File or directory to ignore. Any directories of the
                        given name (and their subdirs) are excluded from the
                        search for changed files. Any modification to files of
                        the given name are ignored. The given value is
                        compared to basenames, so for example, "--ignore=def"
                        will skip the contents of directory "abc/def/" and
                        will ignore file "/ghi/def". Can be specified multiple
                        times.
    --version           Show program's version number and exit.

Description
===========

Rerun detects changes to files by polling file modification times once per
second. On detecting any changes, it clears the terminal and reruns the given
command.

It always ignores directories called .svn, .git, .hg, .bzr, build and dist.

It always ignores files ending with .pyc or .pyo.

e.g::

    rerun python -m unittest mypackage.mymodule

will rerun your tests every time you save your source code. Handy for seeing
the new test results in a console window after you hit 'save' in your editor,
without having to change window focus.

Dependencies
============

Tested on MacOSX, Ubuntu, WindowsXP, Windows 7.

Runs under Python2.7 or 3.2.

May run under Python 2.6 or older with PyPI package 'argparse' installed.

No other dependencies.

Install
=======

::

    pip install rerun

Known Problems
==============

Polling for modification times perhaps isn't ideal. Registering of OS-specific
notifications of file system events might be better. In practice though, I
haven't noticed it burden my machine in directories containing hundreds of
files.

Alternatives
============

PyPI package 'watchdog' is a cross-platform library for handling file-system
events, with which the authors have built script watchmedo, which looks like
a more serious and heavy-duty version of 'rerun'.

Thanks
======

The idea came from the Bash command 'watch', and inspiration for this
implementation came from an old blog post by Jeff Winkler, whos website
http://jeffwinkler.net seems to have now died.
